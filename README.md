# Wedding Website

When my fiance suggested I make [our wedding website](https://wedding.lancegoyke.com), I went looking for some Django templates to start with. I'm delighted to have found this one originally made by [Cory Zue](https://coryzue.com).

I use this as a simple single page app, but there's more functionality built in if you'd like to fork it for yourself, including save the date emails and personal invitation pages.

To deploy this, I use my *AWS EC2* with *gunicorn* and *nginx* ðŸš€

For more info on the original project, see [czue/django-wedding-website](https://github.com/czue/django-wedding-website) and [this blog post](https://www.placecard.me/blog/django-wedding-website/).
