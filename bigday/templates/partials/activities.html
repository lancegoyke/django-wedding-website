              <h4>Nature Center</h4>
              <p>
                  The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7skcqg9tvfEFFmw67">Lilly Nature Center</a> consists of award-winning exhibits and activities designed for the entire family.  The bird viewing
                  area has one-way glass so visitors can see the birds at the feeding stations up close. This is located inside the Celery Bog Nature Area.

              <h4>Celery Bog</h4>
              <p>
                  The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bS3E7VdtHx2kws9SA">Celery Bog Nature Area</a> is approximately 195 acres, consisting of a prairie, a savanna, woodlands and wetlands. It includes
                  over 4 miles of paved, 10â€™ wide trails that connect to the Purdue University campus and other locations throughout West Lafayette. There are also 2.5 miles of mulched paths through the property
                  and three observation decks near the wetlands.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fun fact: As a kid, Allison used to love driving over one road through the celery bog because it would always get bumpy and felt like a mini roller coaster.
              </p>
              <h4>Water Park</h4>
              <p>
                  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4Qg1zF2frLHLbabq8">Tropicanoe Cove</a> is a public swimming pool with a small admission fee.
              </p>
              <h4>Fort Ouiatenon</h4>
              <p>
                  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vpBFPbVaLmCjurA18">Fort Ouiatenon</a> is a replica of the wooden blockhouse that was originally built here in 1717 by the French. Allison went here as a kid and insisted on getting a rabbit pellet because it was so soft, but when they got it home it smelled really bad and she had to keep it in her closet in a plastic bag.
              </p>
              <h4>Escape Room</h4>
              <p>

              </p>
              <h4>Bowling</h4>
              <p>Lance's old hockey friend has a bowling alley up near the fairgrounds: <a href="https://g.page/ArrowheadBowl?share">Mike Aulby's Arrowhead Bowl.</a></p>
              <h4><a href="https://www.westlafayette.in.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/14/144">Happy Hollow</a></h4>
              <p>
                  This is a fun local park you can have a picnic in.
              </p>
              <h4><a href="https://wolfpark.org">Wolf Park</a></h4>
              <p>
                  This was a recommendation from Lance's brother's partner, Sarah! She said it's not quite what you would expect, but that getting to see the wolves up close was very cool!
